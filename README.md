# Data Oriented Engine
A template framework. Suitable for data-oriented app design following the foundation of ECS.  
The whole idea is to bring the performance of the DOD and the readability of other languages to C++.

### TODO
- a better README and documentation
- gcc Ofast compatibility
- currect version-ing
- EntityCommandBuffer
- Garbage collection and recource managment
- rewrite tests
- remove unused includes
- simple systems (transform/hierarchy)
- job chunks buffering
- minimal os-specific main loop (to executing systems, reading system inputs)
